# FriendFinder

### Overview

Compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application for our furry friends. This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. Upon completing the survey, the user receives a modal window displaying the name and picture of the pet with the best overall match.

The application is implemented using a Node.js and Express server on the back end and Bootstrap CSS framework on the front end.

### Demo
This app is deployed through Heroku. You can access a demo [here](https://stark-atoll-68154.herokuapp.com/).
